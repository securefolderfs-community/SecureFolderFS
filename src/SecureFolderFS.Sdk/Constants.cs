                This is the vault folder where important configuration files and your documents in their encrypted form are stored.
                Do not add/remove/modify any files or folders, as doing so may corrupt your vault.
                Any files manually added to this folder or the 'content' folder will NOT be encrypted regardless of whether the vault is unlocked or not.

                To access and securely store your files, first unlock the vault in SecureFolderFS, and then click the 'View vault' button.
                This will open a virtual storage directory where the files you add will be automatically encrypted on the hard drive.
