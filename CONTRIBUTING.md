We always seek constructive conversation and collaboration, we'll notify you on the status update of your issue.

## Before starting work

Issues marked with `triage approved` and those approved by the team can be developed. Make sure to notify others under the issue's thread to avoid duplicating efforts.

## Opening a pull request

We require pull requests to be well organized and match the exact goal of solved problem. Here are some general rules for pull requests:

- Write a good summary of changes you have made
- Test your changes to find unwanted bugs or performance regressions
- Associate pull requests with one issue, unless the solved problem applies to multiple tickets
- Don't fix multiple unrelated issues in one pull request, split them into multiple PRs if needed
